            The formative consultation this week was a necessary reality check for me. I had been operating under the assumption that "Critical Making" was simply rigorous iteration. I thought if I made enough things I was doing it right.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, after reading the literature from Matt Ratto and getting some feedback, I realized the definition is much more political. It uses the act of making to question systems and not just to create products. This forced me to pause and ask a hard question: Am I just making cool lights, or am I actually critiquing the exclusivity of current visual performance tools?
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer was uncomfortably close to the former, so I knew I needed to shift my approach.

                    <p>The performance was stunning, but the visuals were powered by dense shaders. If a performer wants this level of expression, they currently have to be a coder, not just an artist. This highlighted the research gap.</p>

            This realization happened at the same time I attended the Chopa Experimental Music Festival. The performance was a stunning display of audio and visual synchronization. However, when I looked into how it was made I saw a barrier of entry so high it might as well be a wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            This drove a significant pivot in who I am designing for. I had been focusing on "Creative Directors" because I assumed they were the ones stifled by tools. But discussions with my peers helped me realize that Creative Directors often have the resources to hire coders.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real people locked out are the traditional practitioners. These are people with immense creative vision for their art form but who view the computer as an alien entity.

            I also consulted with the SIT team. They suggested exhausting ideas through physical making by using Lego or putty to model interaction. While I appreciate the sentiment of thinking with my hands, I feel the need to move beyond abstract play and into functional prototyping.
          </p>
          <p>
            I need to build tools that actually work rather than just metaphors for tools. The frustration of the week culminated in a realization: I don't want to just speculate on how visuals could be made. I want to build the bridge that allows a non-coder to make them.
