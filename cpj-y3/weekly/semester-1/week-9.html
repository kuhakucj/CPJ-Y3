            Following the formative submission and the start of my Blender experiments I hit a significant block. My experimentation felt aimless. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I found myself questioning the very nature of customization. Does customization mean giving the user a thousand sliders? Or does it mean creating a system that uniquely interprets their input?
          </p>
          <p>
            I suspect the latter, but articulating it in code is difficult. I realized that my aimlessness was actually just me trying to find the logic that connects the user to the visual.

            I visited the Art Science Museum as part of a school activity. While it was educational, I used the experience to think more critically about the role of AI in creative processes. A main takeaway was the necessity of being critical towards inevitable technologies. We often view AI and automation as purely beneficial, but in a creative context they can be reductive.
            </p>
            <p>
            This reinforced my resolve to avoid using AI to generate the art for the user. My system needs to be a tool for their agency and not a replacement for it.
            </p>
            <p>
            I spent time refining the Experiment 3.1 visuals based on this thought process. I tried to see how I could create variations. I made an "abstract" variation and an "error code" variation.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

            The error code variation used the simulation tools to create chaotic and unstable data visualizations. This demonstrated that even messy data can be turned into a unique animation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This week was mostly about thinking and refining. It is hard to constantly produce new physical things every week. Sometimes the work is just staring at a screen and wondering if any of this makes sense.
