            Week 6 was honestly one of the more hectic weeks. We had to do an RPO review where we peer-reviewed each other's research proposals, prep for an experiment showcase, and I was spiraling about my project direction. On Tuesday we were supposed to print out our write-ups and I remember just staring at mine thinking, "is this even making sense anymore?" 
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back now, I'm confused if I was sane during this week—it was such a big stretch trying to do everything at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the last weekend I got the chance to see the reinvention event from design week and also the Sausage Exhibition. The sausage exhibition was wild; it was this experiential thing about food culture and craft which ended up sending me down a weird tangent.

                    <p>I modelled the class table in Blender for peace of mind. By actually measuring it, I realized there was a height difference I wouldn't have guessed. I learned the importance of accurate dimensioning for prototyping.</p>

                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>Reviewing 10 RPOs was rigorous but useful. Key tips were: using simpler, concise language; ensuring all claims of investigation are delivered; and using visuals effectively to aid comprehension.</p>

            I was really lost in terms of direction on what to do for my next experiment because I understand that I wanted to make this visual toolkit but I don't know how to start making without a specific theme or goal. In my mind, I worried: if I do all this exploration, would it not be too aimless?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sausage Exhibition tangent led me to try visualizing food and culinary experiences with code. I wondered if I could make a visual system that captures the craft of cooking. Looking back, I realize this was me just grasping at anything interesting rather than staying focused on the visual toolkit. I was letting the tangent inspire a whole new direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            After consulting, I realized I was straying off, but we also realized my process aligned with Critical Making which is questioning technology through the act of making.

            On Thursday, we had a showcase for our experiments. The only hint Andreas gave us was that he wanted to see "how we think" through our work rather than just seeing polished final outputs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried to make the showcase with determination, even if it was quite last minute. I was scrambling on Thursday because I had an event on Wednesday.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, I was satisfied with how it all turned out, even though I presented mine on Friday instead of Thursday. To adjust, I focused more on clearly showing the thinking and process, making it much simpler than what I would usually do. My main areas for improvement are definitely the explanations of my work, as I hadn't prepared them clearly enough.
