            Seeing in retrospect I see that my views here was too focused on sentimental value and it being very philosophical rather than it being a design based project so afterwards I decided to see everything again in a new lens.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as an introduction to the atelier there was a lot of awkward silence actually- but I hope it'll get better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the start of the semester I suppose I had quite the feeling of pressure of needing to design something that solves something even though I understand we don't necessarily need to necessarily solve something. I wanted my project to at least be meaningful in some way?
          </p>
          <p>
            Like I kept asking myself "what's the point if this doesn't help anyone or change anything" which looking back was probably me just panicking because everyone else seemed to have their topics figured out already.

            I was heavily inspired by this project which was called hylozoic ground which used a lot of mechanic aspects which is why it was very interesting in my eyes because in terms of aesthetics I really like visuals that are 'wild' cries. I cannot do the simplistic style.
          </p>
          <p>
            But then again I guess I understand its not about that its more on how understandable my work is right? Haha Like I kept gravitating towards these complex kinetic installations with tons of moving parts and sensors everywhere but then I'd remember that people need to actually get what I'm trying to say.
          </p>
          <p>
            But another reason why is also because I related with the reason why Philip Beezley was creating this project was because he was using this idea of hylozoic ground.

            Personally I am quite attached to my belongings that I carry sentiments towards which in an extreme case sometimes I name my sensors because it looks cute in my eyes. Some problems that I understand within this topic though is that this idea is not quite applied in the current times where everything is so fast so people simply just come and go and not appreciate things more clearly or reflectively which is why I wanted to do this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this journey of what in the world do I want to do I simply realised that I was so into the Making - I liked everything surrounding IoT and just physical computing stuff or Blender in general so then I also curated my FYP to surround with that type of content.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess I wasnt surrounding it with design focused thinking but it was overall still very interesting because at least I knew I wanted to physically make something with my hands rather than just doing speculative design or service design stuff.
