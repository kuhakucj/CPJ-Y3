            Now that the electronics are functional, they need a body. I focused Experiment 5.2 on 3D modeling and printing the physical interfaces that will house the Piezo sensors.
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed two distinct aesthetic directions. One had sharp and geometric ridges while the other had soft and organic waves.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to test the haptic feedback. I wanted to know how the finger feels when dragging across these surfaces and how that texture translates into vibration data.

            The results were fascinating. Dragging a finger across the 3D printed ridges created a continuous vibration signal. This effectively turned the Piezo into a texture sensor.
          </p>
          <p>
            This allows for sustained visual effects like a continuous flow of particles rather than just percussive bursts. However, the physical integration proved difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sensor needs to be pressed tight against the 3D print to pick up the vibration. But if the tolerance is off by even a millimeter, the signal is lost.

            I considered the idea of combining white plastic 3D printed objects with wooden drums that are centuries old. However, I did not proceed with this integration.
            </p>
            <p>
            During the cohort briefing, seeing other projects made me question this visual language. How do I blend modern clean design with the organic nature of the traditional instrument?
            </p>
            <p>
            The feedback from the elective class helped me refine the sensor housing, but the aesthetic tension remains. I am trying to mend modern characteristics into traditional instruments without making it look like a cyborg parasite. It is a delicate balance of form and function that I have not quite resolved yet.
