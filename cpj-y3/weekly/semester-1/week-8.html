            I spent this week doing ethnographic research. I moved out of my theoretical bubble and spoke to an actual Artistic Director in the Malay percussion scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            I went in with the assumption that perhaps they did not use visuals because they didn't know what they wanted. I was incorrect. They have incredibly specific and meaningful visual ideas. They want "wild" aesthetics and non-literal interpretations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is purely instrumental. Current software affords infinite complexity but zero immediacy. It forces them to become technicians which detaches them from their practice.

                    <p>Performers require cinematic, high-fidelity aesthetics. The complexity must stay hidden in the code (Blender simulations), allowing the user interface to remain simple.</p>

          <p>
            To address this requirement for abstract but meaningful visuals, I began Experiment 3.1. I dove into Blender and its particle simulations. I focused on using the EEVEE rendering engine to create visuals that felt organic rather than geometric.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to see if I could create a system where the chaos of the visuals could be controlled by a simple variable. The goal was to prove that professional aesthetics could be generated without the user needing to touch a single node in the software.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experiment was also a test of my own technical limits. I have never used Blender simulations before so I had to learn on the fly. I realized that the "quality" of the visual is very important to these performers. They do not want low-resolution pixel art. They want something that looks cinematic.
          </p>

          <p>
            By using Blender, I can achieve that high-fidelity look that connects better with their artistic standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result was a series of wild visual states that aligned much better with the performers' descriptions. I created simulations that looked like swarms or flowing water. This confirmed that the software backend needs to be powerful so that the frontend interface can remain simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            The complexity stays in the code so the user does not have to see it. This directly addresses the critique of instrumental affordances identified in the ethnographic phase.
